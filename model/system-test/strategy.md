This document lays out the strategy for building up unit tests for the project. Testing should be deeply integrated into the development process. 

In general, a particular product needs to be tested on three aspects: functionality, integrity and viability. These three aspects map to unit tests, integration tests and E2E tests, in that order. For this shell program, unit tests will be a very common recurrence. Eventually, once we have gotten to the software packaging phase, we will consider how to conduct integration test.

For now, we will focus on unit testing.
